Title:Location-based social network

A location based social network helps people explore what's happening in their neighbourhood,area etc using GPS technology available in phones,tablets,etc.
Basically it fetches your location,find content nearby and shows you.

Existing sol:
	1.Existing location based social networks like Foursquare and Public lets you post stuff only to all people in your area.You can post to all or none.Posting to certain people (like followers) is not possible.
	2.People live far away from their native places,they can't see posts from their native.Existing networks show content only based on current location.

Proposed solution:
	We propose a method which solves the above two problems.
	We introduce Followers feature which lets user post content only to their followers.They have two types of posts: public and private.Public posts are sent to all people in your area.Private posts are shown to people who follow you irrespective of their current location.
	To see posts from native places,we introduce "Select location" feature.
	User selects a location and sees all  public posts from that area.
	To find people to follow,we have a "Find People" feature which shows profiles of people nearby you whom you don't already follow.
	There's also a search feature which lets you search people in your area by their username.
