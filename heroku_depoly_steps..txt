1.Create app
https://dashboard.heroku.com/new-app

2.Inside the project folder,create required files Procfile (does migrations.Means auth_user is created),runtime.txt,requirements.txt

3.Follow onscreen instructions from step1 to init the remote etc at our system
.Do not push yet.

4.Create a postgres instance for your project (first time only)
	Do this inside (where .git is) the project
	heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev --version=12
The created instance has been added to this app (project)

5. Change db_handle.py to access remote db,change settings.py accordingly,get secret_key from os.environ instead of hardcoding.
DO ALL DJANGO PRODUCTION STEPS.E.G DISABLE DEBUG,ETC

6.Connect to that db and create tables you created at local like below(first time only):
	heroku pg:psql --app app_name_
	Now you'll get a shell.Type queries etc.

	Or you can dump the contents of local db to cloud (not so recommended) like below:
	"heroku pg:push postgres://postgres:jaxtek@localhost:5432/postgres DATABASE --app app_name_here"

When you change tables in local ,you should change in cloud too(as req..).

7.Inside project ,do this:
	heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1
8.Push to
	git push heroku master
