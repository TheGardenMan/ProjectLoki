during public_post_success,loc is sent from client via the req itself.
--------
during public_feed,front-end sends req to update_user_location first.Then it calls public_feed.public_feed gets the location from said table.
-------
We show only deleted=false posts.
If post was deleted in the middle? S3 still gives the URL.Front-end detects the delete when req-ing that file.Then it proceeds not to show that file.
DeletedFile reply from S3:
	<Error>
	<Code>NoSuchKey</Code>
	<Message>The specified key does not exist.</Message>
	<Key>public_124_2.jpg</Key>
	<RequestId>68DEB5E319784114</RequestId>

DRF doesn't do pwd validation other than min length=8.So we use Django's validators.But they're too strict.
So write custom validator;

Just import then and use:

Postman requests Content-Type should be "application/json".It is the standard.
And in drf view ,access like request.data["username"]
	--Non-standard If you are using multi-formdata in Postman or formData in fronr-end,in drf accees like request.POST.get("username")
