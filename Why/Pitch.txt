As shown in the pics,all companies are trying to get small stores online.
Jio wanna rule the digital India.All companies want to list the businesses.

If we get good amount of users to use our platform,we might hit gold.
Why all previous companies failed is due to low market adoption.
People just dont wanna use an app full of business listings.
So lets give them something cool first.
Once they start using it regularly,we will roll out business listings.
People can follow their favourite stores,etc.
If there's a new item to sell,if there's an offer on weekends or festivals,if someone wants to find a service in the city,if something happens in the city, Our platform should be their only choice.What we wont do ( for now) is deliveries.Coz it requires more than code.
We will launch this only in India coz there's no GDPR,or other data protection laws.
We will ride anti-chinese,"Made in India" wave to get more users (Ex.Mitron app)
When we have enough users and enough biz listings,we will have good valuation.
We have one year of time.We all are home and comfortable.We can build it.
If we dont have money,we can try to get into YC (!!) or get some other investor.
Once we have a good product:
			1.We can sell ads (We'll fig out how)
			2.Get acquired by a Jio competitor or some foreign company who wanna get into Indian market

We all need to work hard.
We are building something cool first, useful next.
