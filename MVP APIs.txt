Since we are running out of time and haven't begun work on front-end,we are gonna make significant process today.
Our priority is front-end:
	Along with public posts,we should add one unique feature which is setting custom location.We can simplify it by using a form first and then a MapView if possible.
So this week:
	1.Ramanan will write all private post related APIs before 11-OCT-2020-SUNDAY
		(I will call him and explain the procedure via Zoom)
		(If he can't finish due to Samsung stuff,I will take care of it.)
	2.Jagadees will start work on front-end tomorrow and finish public posts and custom_user_location (important feature that diffs our project) before 11-OCT-2020-SUNDAY
	3.Kishore will convert all of our tables into diagrams ( and make them as one ER diagram if possible) ( I will tell him in call) before 11-OCT-2020-SUNDAY
	4.Sathya will take care of 
		1.architecture diagram and modules (I will explain to him in call )
		2.Compile front-end code to APKs.If not possible,we will stick with web version
	5.On next Monday itself,our PPT for next review should be ready.We can add more features after that.Safety first.

Sunday:
	1.Kishore will start work on tables-to-diag.
	2.Sathya will compile first APK and get to know full flow of modules from me
	3.Ramanan will start work on private APIs after Zoom
	4.Jagadees will start work on custom_user_location API and front-end

If EY interview date is announced,I will prepare the day before.No other go.We dont have time.

Since I cant focus on aptitude preparation,Ramanan (and sathya-but mostly Ramanan) has to help me with online tests as they have always done.Help me with CTS online test next Sunday,and Intel intern test on Monday!

I know there are 3 of us not placed yet.But complete the above tasks within this week and you are free to go.
We need to finish the project ASAP so full collaboration is required.
We will talk at 8PM today.Think of some solutions I might have missed and let me know in call.
*No mistakes.No do-overs*
