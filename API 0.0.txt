36.accepted_follow_requests/
		Flow:
			First ever request (request without top_flag):
				Initially there are no data at client.
				Client sends request at gets 5 notifs in descending order.Stores accept_id of latest of 5 as "top_flag".Stores accept_id of oldest of 5 as "bottom_flag"
				Client sends back the bottom_flag and gets content older than and sets oldest thme as "bottom_flag".Continiues until server runs out of data.Then bottom_flag is cleared.
			Once top_flag is set,following method is used:
				First request is sent without any flags.After receiving them all,latest of them is set as "temp_top_flag"
				Further requests happen using bottom_flag and so on until one of the received accept_ids match with top_flag.This means we have started receiving "already received data".Hence client stops further requests and set top_flag=temp_top_flag.
				temp_top_flag,bottom_flag are cleared.
